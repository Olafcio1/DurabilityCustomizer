unsafe:
  # This is a special tag useful for when you've set up your server to use the unbreakable tag,
  # but messed it up at some part.
  #
  # For example:
  # > **Problem:**
  #   The shopkeepers have all cost items with unbreakability,
  #   but output breakable items.
  #
  #   **Solution:**
  #   Set `enabled` to true,
  #       `value`   to true.
  #
  # > **Problem:**
  #   The shopkeepers have all items without unbreakability,
  #   so you've installed another plugin to make all items unbreakable.
  #
  #   The plugin that was supposed to fix the issue made it even worse,
  #   as it added the Unbreakable:1b tag, which wasn't described anywhere.
  #
  #   **Solution:**
  #   Set `enabled` to true,
  #       `value`   to false.
